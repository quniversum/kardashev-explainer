## The Concept

This project was inspired by an article exploring the long-term future of humanity and the Kardashev scale, a method of measuring a civilization's technological advancement based on energy consumption.

My goal was to create more than just a calculator. I wanted to build an **explainer**—a tool that not only computes the number but also provides the user with the crucial context and description for what that number represents. It bridges the gap between raw data and true understanding.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Calculation:** Allows users to input any energy value and see the corresponding Kardashev level instantly.
- **Dynamic Explanations:** The tool doesn't just show a number; it provides a clear, written description of the civilization type (e.g., "A Planetary Civilization"), demonstrating the ability to connect data with narrative.
- **Educational Focus:** Designed from the ground up to be a simple and effective tool for teaching a fascinating scientific concept.

## Technologies Used
