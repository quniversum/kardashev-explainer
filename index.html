        <h1>From Dirt to Dyson Spheres: Humanity's Long Road to the Stars</h1>
        <p>
          We began as humble earthlings – just one species on a dust-covered
          planet – but we've always gazed skyward. Our blue marble gave us life
          and shelter, yet in cosmic terms, it's a ticking clock... In short,
          the Earth of today won't last forever.

        <h2>Climbing the Energy Ladder – The Kardashev Scale</h2>
        <p>
          Cosmically speaking, one way to measure a civilization's reach is by
          how much energy it commands. The Kardashev scale categorizes
          civilizations by energy usage. Below is a live demo that lets you
          explore this concept.
